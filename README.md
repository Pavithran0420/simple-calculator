# Basic Calculator

A simple console-based calculator program written in Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with a menu-driven approach.
- Handles invalid input gracefully with error messages.
- Includes protection against division by zero.
- Supports the following operations:
  - **Addition** (`+`)
  - **Subtraction** (`-`)
  - **Multiplication** (`*`)
  - **Division** (`/`)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the program in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python basic_calculator.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the first number.
   - Enter the second number.
   - Select an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
4. View the result or an error message for invalid input.

## Example

Here's how the program works when you run it:

```
Welcome to the Basic Calculator!
Choose an operation:
1: Addition (+)
2: Subtraction (-)
3: Multiplication (*)
4: Division (/)

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (1/2/3/4): 1
The result of 10.0 + 5.0 is 15.0.
```

## Error Handling

- If non-numeric input is entered for numbers, the program will display an error message:  
  `"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values for numbers."`
- Division by zero is not allowed, and the program will display:  
  `"Error: Division by zero is not allowed."`
- Invalid operation choices will prompt:  
  `"Invalid operation. Please choose 1, 2, 3, or 4."`

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add support for more operations (e.g., modulus, exponentiation).
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Allow continuous calculations without restarting the program.
- Add unit tests for better code reliability.
